🔍 1. Project Overview

This project analyzes Blinkit’s sales dataset containing 8,523 rows and 12 columns, covering:

1. Product characteristics

2. Item category & fat content

3. Outlet attributes (size, location, establishment year)

4. Sales performance

5. Customer ratings


The analysis includes:

1. Data cleaning & preparation

2. Exploratory visualizations

3. KPI analysis

4. Business insights

5. Patterns across outlets and product categories

The goal is to derive meaningful insights for business growth, optimized product management, and improved customer experience.

📊 2. Key Business KPIs Analyzed

✔ Total Sales
✔ Average Sales per Item
✔ Number of Items Sold
✔ Average Customer Ratings

These KPIs help evaluate product demand, revenue contribution, customer preferences, and outlet performance.

📈 3. Detailed EDA Insights

1️⃣ Total Sales by Fat Content

Compares revenue contribution of different product fat types (e.g., Low Fat vs. Regular).

Regular-fat items often dominate sales, indicating a preference for taste over dietary concerns.

2️⃣ Total Sales by Item Type

Analyzes revenue across categories such as snacks, beverages, household items, dairy, etc.

Consumable categories like snacks, beverages, dairy tend to generate higher sales.

Essential for inventory and category management.

3️⃣ Fat Content by Outlet for Total Sales

Multi-variable comparison of fat content sales across outlet types.

Helps identify:

Outlets specializing in specific nutritional segments

Urban–rural differences in customer preferences

4️⃣ Total Sales by Outlet Establishment Year

Older outlets generally show higher cumulative sales due to customer trust and market familiarity.

Newer outlets help identify early growth patterns and scalability potential.

5️⃣ Sales by Outlet Size

Outlets are classified as Small, Medium, and Large.

Insights typically show:

Large outlets → Highest revenue (wider inventory & better logistics)

Small outlets → Higher transaction volume but lower revenue

6️⃣ Sales by Outlet Location Type

Compares sales across Tier 1, Tier 2, and Tier 3 locations.

General trends include:

Tier 3 locations often contribute surprisingly high sales due to concentrated demand.

Tier 1 outlets show higher basket value per order.

🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation

The notebook includes:

✅Missing value handling

✅Standardizing text entries (e.g., fat content labels)

✅Converting data types

✅Outlier detection

✅Exploratory statistics for categorical & numerical variables

Ensuring all visualizations and insights are accurate and reliable.
